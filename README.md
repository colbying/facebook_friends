FB friend search instant!
==============================

I was originally working on a project that sort of emulated the organizational aspect
of spotme and the payment implementation of venmo. My original plan was to use
facebook's login to authorize venmo users, except venmo changed their API in
the middle of working on it! Venmo now supports an OATH2 so I don't have to use
FB's API now. The page looks sloppy, but I decided to save this bit of facebook
login code because it's somewhat neat.
